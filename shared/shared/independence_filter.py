"""
Independence interval filtering for camera trap statistics.

Groups detections of the same species at the same camera within N minutes
as a single independent event. The count for each event is the maximum
individuals seen in any single image within that event.

This is the standard approach in camera trap ecology (O'Brien et al. 2003),
used by camtrapR, Camelot, eMammal, and Snapshot Safari.
