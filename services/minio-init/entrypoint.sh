# MinIO bucket + cold-tier initialization.
#
# Reads config from env (set by docker-compose). Idempotent: re-run on every
# deploy. When COLD_TIER_ENABLED=true, registers the remote tier and installs
# the tag-based ILM rules. Recreates the tier registration if bucket or
# endpoint changed since the last run, which lets a Wasabi-bucket swap happen
# fully via ansible (no manual `mc ilm tier rm` step on the server).

# at the `mc ilm tier add` below, before it ever reached the transition rule.
# Every cold-tier server ran for months with minio-init exiting 1 and
# raw-images holding expiry rules but no transition, so nothing ever drained.
