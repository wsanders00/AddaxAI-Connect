"""
Bulk-upload worker

One message per job, phase="process", published by the API once the
client has finished uploading every file to the job's staging prefix.
The worker lists the prefix, ingests each object into the live
pipeline via the bulk priority queues, then deletes the staging. Status
moves uploading -> processing -> done (lazily, on API read, once
detection and classification finish).

Bulk-origin images carry origin='bulk' through every queue message.
That gates notification fan-out at the classification stage so an
SD-card import never fires species_detection alerts retroactively.

Legacy path: jobs created before the per-file refactor have a
staged_object_key ending in '.zip' and used a separate "inspect" phase.
That path is retained so any in-flight legacy job can drain after the
refactor lands. New jobs use the prefix layout.
