/**
 * Dashboard Overview tab: the state of the whole project.
 *
 * Laid out as tiles of different sizes, where size is decided by how much the
 * content matters. The old page gave every card the same weight, so the eye
 * had no entry point and settled on whatever had the most ink, which happened
 * to be a red doughnut.
 *
 * What changed and why:
 *
 * The camera activity doughnut is gone. Camera health is a status question,
 * not a proportion question, and it now sits in the attention list with the
 * other things a person can act on.
 *
 * The species bar chart is gone, replaced by a ranked list. The bars were
 * coloured from a continuous scale even though the name was already on the
 * axis, so the colour said nothing while implying an order.
 *
 * The three plain counters gained a comparison, because a total with nothing
 * to compare it against cannot be judged.
 *
 * Photographs appear only where they are big enough to read: the hero tile
 * here, and the wall on the Explore tab. A tried-and-dropped version put a
 * cropped portrait on every species row, and at 44 pixels a night infrared
 * shot is a grey rectangle.
 *
 * No filters at all. This is the front page and it always shows the whole
 * project: every figure is the project entire, over its whole history.
 *
 * The tab deliberately ignores the site and date parameters the URL may carry
 * from Explore, which shares the address. Reading them would mean the page
 * quietly filtered itself with no control on screen to explain why, and the
 * only thing worse than a missing filter is an invisible one.
 *
 * It also means every card here is one less thing to keep in step. A filter is
 * a promise that every card honours it, and a card that does not honour it
 * lies rather than fails.
