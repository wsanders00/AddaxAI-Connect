/**
 * Cameras that want a visit, as one compact strip.
 *
 * Lives here rather than on the Cameras page because the dashboard shows the
 * same thing. Two versions of "what is wrong with the cameras" would drift
 * apart, and the thresholds are the part that must not.
 *
 * It renders nothing at all when everything is fine. A card that says "all
 * good" costs the same space as one that says something useful, and the
 * absence of the strip is already the message.
 *
 * Chips act differently depending on who is asking. The Cameras page passes
 * onSelect and filters its own table in place. The dashboard passes projectId
 * instead and gets links into that page with the filter already applied,
 * which works because the camera filters live in the URL. The dashboard also
 * passes the overdue service task count, a chip that links to the Service
 * page instead.
