    Resolve the site and deployment for a new GPS reading and return
    (site_id, deployment_id).

    One distance rule governs both (SITE_THRESHOLD_METERS, from shared.geo):
    a reading more than that far from the camera's active deployment means the
    camera left its site, so the active deployment is closed and a new one opens
    at the resolved site. Within the threshold it is the same deployment. Sites
    are reused when an existing one in the project is within the threshold,
    otherwise one is auto-created. site_id is None only when the camera has no
    project, since sites are project-scoped.

    allow_relocation gates the split: photos pass True (a photo is the evidence a
    deployment is built from). Daily health reports pass False, because a report
    carries GPS but no photo, so a report must never move a camera between sites
    or split its deployment, it would only leave behind a deployment with zero
    images. A report still creates the first deployment when none is active and
    still heals a missing site within the threshold.

    image_uuid is the photo carrying this reading (None for reports). An
    out-of-range reading's image attaches to the current deployment while the
    debounce holds it, but its uuid rides on the candidate; a confirmed move
    relinks the held images to the new deployment, where they were shot.
