"""
Bulk image upload endpoints

Project-admin-only. The client scans the user's folder locally, picks a
camera, then POSTs one file at a time to a job's staging prefix. Once
every file is in MinIO the client calls /finalize, which flips the job
to 'processing' and publishes to the bulk-upload worker.

Status flow:
    uploading -> processing -> done | failed

Legacy jobs created before the per-file refactor (statuses queued,
inspecting, awaiting_confirmation) are still readable but cannot be
resumed; they expire via the orphan-cleanup pass.
