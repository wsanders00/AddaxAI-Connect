    Compare AI predictions against human verifications for a project,

    - Aggregate per-species instance counts (sum of human observation counts
      vs count of visible AI detections). Good for spotting per-species bias.
    - Subject-level confusion matrix, including empty/person/vehicle as
      classes. Good for spotting which species the AI confuses for which.

    The matrix pairs subject by subject rather than collapsing each image to
    one label per side, because an image with a person next to a car holds
    two correct predictions, not one right and one wrong. See
    utils/performance_pairing.py for the pairing rules. Both views therefore
    count subjects and agree with each other.

    Both views honor the project's detection and classification thresholds
    so the comparison matches what the user sees in the rest of the UI.
