"""
Site scope helpers for site-restricted project-viewer memberships.

A scope is Optional[List[int]]. None means unrestricted (server admin,
project admin, or an unscoped viewer). A list means the caller may only
see those sites. An empty list is forbidden as a stored value (validated
here), but valid as a runtime filter after intersection, where it simply
matches nothing.

Two camera-site semantics coexist on purpose:

- Statistics and image filters use the deployment the image belongs to
  (site_image_clause) or any deployment ever at the sites
  (cameras_at_sites_clause). Time-correct: historical images count for
  the site the camera stood at when they were captured.
- Camera visibility (list, detail, export) uses the camera's current
  site, meaning its latest deployment (cameras_current_site_clause). A
  camera with no deployment or no resolved site has no current site and
  is invisible under a restricted scope, fail closed.

No FastAPI imports here so the pure helpers stay importable from the
unit tests without an app context.
