"""
Role-based permission checking for multi-project access control.

Provides helper functions and FastAPI dependencies for checking user permissions:
- Server admin: Full access to all projects and system administration
- Project admin: Can manage specific projects (cameras, species, users)
- Project viewer: Read-only access to specific projects

Design principles:
- Crash early and loudly if permissions are violated
- Explicit permission checks on every endpoint
- No implicit access - all access must be validated
