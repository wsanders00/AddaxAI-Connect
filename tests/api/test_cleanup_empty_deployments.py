"""Pruning empty deployments after a curation delete.

Guards against the bug class that broke curation twice. The empty-deployment
branch of `cleanup_empty_deployments` kept a guard on Deployment columns that
were later dropped (`dep.notes`, fixed 17 Jun 2026 in aff5725d, then
`dep.name`, dropped 3 Jul 2026 in 7060d307), so every delete or hide that
emptied a deployment raised AttributeError and 500'd, which the UI showed as
nothing happening. Found on lab, 19 Sep 2026.

The tests run the helper against real Deployment ORM instances, so a
reference to a column that no longer exists on the model fails here instead
of on a production server.

Also pinned here: pruning runs on the delete path only. Bulk hide must not
prune, because `Image.deployment_id` is SET NULL on deployment delete and an
unhide cannot restore it, which permanently detaches the images from their
site.
