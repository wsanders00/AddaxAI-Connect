# AddaxAI Connect

An open-source platform that automatically processes camera trap images with machine learning. It picks up images from your cameras via FTPS, detects and classifies animals, and shows you everything in a web interface with maps, charts, and notifications. Fully self-hosted on a single server.

## Getting started

1. [Check camera compatibility](camera-requirements.md): any FTPS-capable camera works, but each model needs a profile. See the list of supported cameras and how to add yours
2. [Deploy your server](deployment.md) with Ansible (about an hour)
3. [Set up your project](setup-guide.md): register, configure settings, add cameras, invite users
4. If you chose SpeciesNet, follow the [SpeciesNet setup](speciesnet-setup.md) for taxonomy mapping

## Using the app

- [Sites and cameras](sites-and-deployments.md): how images are organised by place, and how camera moves are handled
- [Service](service.md): plan field work on your cameras and keep their service history
- [Install as an app](install-as-app.md): put AddaxAI Connect on your phone or computer

## Integrations

- [EarthRanger](integrations/earthranger.md): send detections and camera alerts to an EarthRanger site as events on the ranger map
- [Sensing Clues](integrations/sensingclues.md): send detections and camera alerts to a Sensing Clues group as observations in the Cluey app

## Running your server

- [Operations and monitoring](operations.md): check service health, view logs, monitor the pipeline
- [Update guide](update-guide.md): safely update to new versions with backup and rollback
- [Testing an update](test-update.md): run an update against a copy of your production data first
- [Restore guide](restore-guide.md): rebuild a server from a backup when the old one is lost

## Developer

- [Architecture](architecture.md): technology stack, data flow, services, data storage, security, and user roles
- [Dev server setup](dev-server-setup.md): create a development server holding a copy of production data
