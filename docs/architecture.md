## Data flow

```
FTPS upload
    ↓
Ingestion service
    → validates image (MIME type, magic bytes)
    → extracts EXIF metadata (GPS, timestamp, camera ID)
    → uploads raw image to MinIO
    → creates database record
    → publishes to "image-ingested" queue
         ↓
Detection service
    → downloads image from MinIO
    → runs MegaDetector inference
    → saves bounding boxes and confidence scores
    → publishes to "detection-complete" queue
         ↓
Classification service (DeepFaune or SpeciesNet)
    → crops detected regions
    → classifies species
    → generates annotated images with boxes and labels
    → applies privacy blur to people and vehicles
    → publishes to "classification-complete" queue
         ↓
Notifications service
    → evaluates per-user notification preferences
    → creates audit log entries
    → routes to delivery channels:
         → notification-email queue → Email worker (SMTP)
         → notification-telegram queue → Telegram worker (Bot API)
    → runs scheduled jobs:
         → daily battery digests
         → daily/weekly/monthly email reports
         → excessive image alerts
         → project inactivity alerts
```

## Services

All services run as Docker containers on a single host, connected through a shared bridge network.

### Infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** is the central database for all application data
- **Redis** handles message queues between services and pub/sub for real-time WebSocket events
- **MinIO** provides S3-compatible storage for raw images, crops, thumbnails, and annotated images. Recent raw images live on the server; older ones transition to a remote cold tier under a configurable size budget. Reads remain transparent via the local MinIO API.

### Application
- **API** (FastAPI, port 8000) serves REST endpoints, WebSocket connections, and authentication. Interactive API docs (Swagger UI) are available at `/api/docs` on your server.

![Swagger UI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0942b03-9d3c-4843-bcd0-aac592eb2276)

- **Frontend** (React via Nginx, port 3000) is the web interface

Ingestion also groups images into cameras, sites, and deployments from their GPS, and reports each decision in the camera updates feed. See [sites and cameras](sites-and-deployments.md) for how that works.

### Workers
- **Ingestion** watches the FTPS upload directory for new files
- **Detection** runs MegaDetector object detection
- **Classification** identifies species (DeepFaune or SpeciesNet, selected via Docker Compose profile)
- **Notifications** evaluates rules and runs scheduled jobs
- **Notifications-email** delivers emails via SMTP
- **Notifications-telegram** delivers messages via Telegram Bot API
- **Notifications-earthranger** posts events to an EarthRanger site through Gundi
- **Notifications-sensingclues** posts observations into a Sensing Clues group through Central

## Docker Compose profiles

The `docker-compose.yml` uses profiles to support different configurations:

- **`deepfaune`** is the full stack with DeepFaune classifier (38 European species)
- **`speciesnet`** is the full stack with SpeciesNet classifier (2,498 global species)
- **`demo`** runs only the API, database, and frontend (no ML workers, for demos and development)

On a server with an NVIDIA GPU, `docker-compose.gpu.yml` is layered on top through `COMPOSE_FILE` in `.env` (written by Ansible when `use_gpu` is true). It gives the detection and classification workers the GPU; everything else is unchanged.

## Data storage

By default, all data stays on your own server. PostgreSQL holds the metadata (projects, cameras, detections, users), and MinIO holds the image files (raw images, thumbnails, crops, annotated images). Neither is reachable from the internet.

Two optional features copy data to a remote S3-compatible bucket:

- **Cold storage tier**. When the raw images on local disk grow past a configurable budget, the oldest ones move to a remote bucket. Reads stay transparent, MinIO fetches cold objects on demand. Thumbnails, crops, and annotated images always stay on the server. See [operations](operations.md#cold-storage-tier).
- **Daily backups**. A nightly job dumps the database and mirrors all image buckets to a separate remote bucket, so a lost server can be rebuilt from the backup alone. See the [restore guide](restore-guide.md).

You choose the remote provider yourself. Any S3-compatible service works (Wasabi, AWS S3, Backblaze B2, and similar). You bring your own buckets and access keys, so the remote data stays under your own account. The system is developed and tested with [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com), and the servers hosted by Addax Data Science and Smart Parks store their cold images and backups on Wasabi as well.

Security of the remote storage:

- All transfers to the remote bucket go over HTTPS.
- Access keys are scoped to a single bucket with minimal permissions. The backup key has no delete permission.
- Cold tier and backups use separate buckets with separate keys, so one leaked key never exposes both.
- The backup bucket keeps old versions of every object for 90 days, so an accidental overwrite or a compromised server cannot silently destroy the backup history.
- Objects are stored as-is, encryption at rest is handled by the provider. Wasabi encrypts all stored data at rest by default.

## Security

The system uses multiple layers of protection:

- **Network isolation**. PostgreSQL, Redis, and MinIO are only reachable within the Docker network, not from the internet.
- **TLS everywhere**. Nginx terminates HTTPS with Let's Encrypt certificates, FTPS uses explicit TLS.
- **Authentication on all services**. Password protection on the database, Redis, MinIO, and FTPS.
- **Firewall**. UFW restricts inbound traffic to SSH, HTTP/HTTPS, and FTPS ports only.
- **Server access by SSH key only**. Password login is switched off.
- **Brute-force protection**. fail2ban blocks an address after five failed SSH logins. FTPS is deliberately left out, because all cameras share one account on mobile networks and one wrong password could ban a whole site.
- **Automatic security updates**. The server installs its own operating system security patches every day, and reboots only when a patch needs it.
- **Daily security check**. The same check that runs at the end of every deployment also runs each night, and emails server admins when something has drifted.
- **Role-based access control**. Three-tier permission system (server admin, project admin, project viewer).

The system does not include intrusion detection, file integrity monitoring, or log shipping to a separate system. It notices damage, like a disk filling up or a worker that died, rather than a quiet intruder.

## User roles

Three levels of access:

- **Server admin** has full access to all projects and manages all users
- **Project admin** manages specific projects, can invite users to their projects, and can create a new project (becoming its admin). Deleting a project stays with the server admin.
- **Project viewer** has read-only access to assigned projects

Users can have different roles across different projects. The initial server admin is created during deployment. Other users are invited through the web interface.
