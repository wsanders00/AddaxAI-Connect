# Update guide

How to update a production server.

Test it first on a dev server with a copy of this server's data. See
[testing an update](test-update.md). Three minutes, and it catches most
problems before production sees them.

## 1. Check the backup

*(on the production server)*

The nightly backup is your rollback. Make sure it ran.

```bash
cd /opt/addaxai-connect && tail -3 logs/backup.log
```

Look for `Backup complete`, today or yesterday. If it is older, run
`bash scripts/backup.sh` and wait.

## 2. Sync the config

*(on your laptop)*

Writes `.env` from your `host_vars` and installs any new cron jobs.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory.yml ansible/playbook.yml \
  --limit <server> --tags sync-config
```

Do this **before** the rebuild. New code sometimes reads a new setting.

## 3. Check out the release and rebuild

*(on the production server)*

```bash
cd /opt/addaxai-connect
git fetch origin --tags
git checkout vX.Y.Z
docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate
```

Take the version from the [releases page](https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/AddaxAI-Connect/releases),
or the newest tag with `git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -1` after the fetch.
Servers run tagged releases, never the head of `main`. A tag is what was
tested against production data. The code is baked into the images, so the
rebuild is not optional.

## 4. Migrate

*(on the production server)*

```bash
bash scripts/update-database.sh
```

Watch the output. Most update problems show up here.

## 5. Verify

*(on the production server)*

```bash
bash scripts/verify-server.sh
```

Checks containers, migrations, health, read-only endpoints against your real
data, a sample of images, and the logs. Prints `PASS` or `FAIL`.

Then open the site and log in.

## If it goes wrong

Migrations do not roll back safely, so restore the database instead.

```bash
cd /opt/addaxai-connect
git checkout <previous-tag>
docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate
bash scripts/restore.sh <this-server-domain> --force
```

Check out the old code first, so it matches the schema in the backup. List
tags with `git tag --sort=-creatordate | head -5`.

Going back to a tag before v0.13.1 needs one extra step first. Those releases
pull MinIO images that no longer exist, and the weekly image prune removes the
local copies once nothing uses them. Give the current image the old names:

```bash
docker tag addaxai-connect-minio minio/minio:latest
docker tag addaxai-connect-minio minio/mc:RELEASE.2025-08-13T08-35-41Z
```

If the server is broken rather than the data, build a new one from the backup.
See the [restore guide](restore-guide.md).
